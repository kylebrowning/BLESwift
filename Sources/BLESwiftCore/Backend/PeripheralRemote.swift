/// This is BLESwift's backend implementation seam. BLESwift ships two conformances —
/// CoreBluetooth (the `BLESwift` module) and scriptable fakes (`BLESwiftTestSupport`).
/// Conforming your own types is possible but unsupported: the semantic contract (event
/// ordering, queue confinement, delivery asynchrony) is documented here on a best-effort
/// basis and may gain requirements in any release.
///
/// A protocol seam over `CBPeripheral`, mirroring only the API surface BLESwift uses,
/// speaking exclusively in BLESwift-owned (never CoreBluetooth) types.
///
/// `CBPeripheral` has no accessible public initializer and cannot be instantiated in
/// tests, so `Central` (in the `BLESwift` module) is written entirely against this
/// protocol instead of the concrete CoreBluetooth type. `CBPeripheral` conforms
/// retroactively (`BLESwift`'s `CBPeripheral+PeripheralRemote.swift`); `BLESwiftTestSupport`'s
/// `FakePeripheral` conforms for tests, standing in for hardware.
///
/// **Identifier-based, not object-graph-based.** Real `CBPeripheral` GATT operations
/// take `CBService`/`CBCharacteristic` object references, which only exist once
/// discovery has run. `PeripheralRemote` instead takes BLESwift's ``ServiceIdentifier`` and
/// ``CharacteristicIdentifier`` value types throughout; the `CBPeripheral` conformance
/// resolves those identifiers to the underlying `CBService`/`CBCharacteristic` internally,
/// silently no-op-ing an operation whose service or characteristic has not yet
/// been discovered. This keeps the fake peripheral trivial (no `CBService`/`CBCharacteristic`
/// stand-ins needed) and avoids a nested existential hierarchy.
///
/// - Important: Every ``eventHandler`` delivery must happen **asynchronously**, on the
///   single serial `DispatchSerialQueue` the owning `Central` was constructed with — never
///   deliver inline from within a method call on this protocol.
///
/// - Note: ``connectionState`` is named to avoid colliding with `CBPeripheral`'s own
///   identically-named `state` property — see ``CentralManaging``'s note on
///   ``CentralManaging/radioState``/``CentralManaging/bluetoothAuthorization`` for why.
